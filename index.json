A small amount of recent CDR works have investigated the privacy protection, while they still suffer from satisfying practical requirements (e.g., limited privacy-preserving ability) and preventing the potential risk of negative transfer. To address above challenging problems, we propose a novel and unified privacy-preserving federated framework for dual-target CDR, namely P2FCDR.We design P2FCDR as peer-to-peer federated network architecture to ensure the local data storage and privacy protection of business partners. Specifically, for the special knowledge transfer process in CDR under federated settings, we initialize an optimizable orthogonal mapping matrix to learn the embedding transformation across domains and adopt the local differential privacy technique on the transformed embedding before exchanging across domains, which provides the more reliable privacy protection. Furthermore, we exploit the similarity between in-domain and cross-domain embedding, and develop a gated selecting vector to refine the information fusion for more accurate dual-transfer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that P2FCDR significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and effectively protects data privacy.","tags":["Cross-domain Recommendation","Federated Learning","Recommendation System"],"title":"Win-Win: A Privacy-Preserving Federated Framework for Dual-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Urban anomalies, like traffic congestion and unexpected crowd gathering, usually occur in urban environments.

However, it is difficult to collect such information in most realistic scenarios.

In this paper, we propose a neural approach for demographic prediction based on user reviews. The core of our approach is a deep multi-view multi-task learning model. Our model first learns context representations from reviews using a context encoder, which takes semantics and syntactics into consideration. Meanwhile, we learn sentiment and topic representations from selected sentiment and topic words using a word encoder separately, which consists of a convolutional neural network to capture the local contexts of reviews in word-level. Then, we learn a unified user representation from context, sentiment and topic representations and apply multi-task learning for inferring user’s gender and age simultaneously.

A variety of available check-in data make it possible to build a personalized POI recommender system, but the extreme sparsity of check-in data poses a severe challenge for POI recommendation. Recent studies mainly utilize social information, categorical information and/or geographical information to supplement the highly sparse check-in data. However, these studies often apply shallow methods for the extra information and provide considerably limited improvements on POI recommendation. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained POI recommendation framework, called FGRec to capture the intrinsic influences of social, categorical and geographical information on the check-in behaviors of users. First, we study the social influence in depth by exploiting the multi-hop social friends and top-n nearest neighbor friends, not only the direct friends (i.e., 1-hop friends). Second, we investigate the categorical influence by factorizing both user-POI and user-category matrices simultaneously over the same user embedding space, rather than simply using the popularity of POI categories. Third, we explore the geographical influence by integrating two types of distance (i.e., the distance between user homes and POIs and the distance among POIs) into a unified probability distribution over check-in POIs, instead of modeling them separately. Finally, experimental results on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.","tags":["Location-based Social Network","Spatio-Temporal AI","Recommendation System"],"title":"FGRec: A Fine-Grained Point-of-Interest Recommendation Framework by Capturing Intrinsic Influences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiang Li","Yijun Su","Neng Gao","Ji Xiang","Yuewu Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595116800,"objectID":"ca9d136935b762011099bd7b05cac34f","permalink":"https://yijunsu.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2020-ijcnn-jsaip/","publishdate":"2020-07-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2020-ijcnn-jsaip/","section":"publication","summary":"User Alignment is to find users belonging to a same real person on different social networks and has become a fundamental task for many sequent applications such as cross-network recommendation systems.

However, the completeness and validity of original alignment information among seeds cannot be fully preserved when learning and aligning multiple user spaces. In this paper, we propose a unified framework named Jumping Seed Alignment Information Propagation (JSAIP) to flexibly leverage, for each user, complete and correct alignment information from seeds. Specifically, JSAIP learns a reasonable user space for each social network by preserving enough original network and label information. Then, JSAIP ensures the correct alignment among seeds and shared labels to reduce the diversity between different user spaces. Finally, JSAIP constructs jumping links from seeds to each user in each social network and ultilizes original seed alignment information to enhance or rectify the alignment information propagated from neighbors.

First, current coarse-grained geographical models provide considerably limited improvements on POI recommendations and fail to capture the overall impact of fine-grained geographical characteristics in LBSNs. Second, previous methods such as matrix factorization always give equal weight to each positive example and may not distinguish between their different contributions in learning the objective function. To cope with these challenges, we develop a fine-grained POI recommendation framework that makes full use of the geographical characteristics from both users’ and locations’ perspectives. For capturing the fine-grained geographical influence, we present a unified probability distribution model based on four key geographical characteristics. For mining more contribution information from positive examples, we assign a higher weight to highlight the contribution of a higher check-in frequency by employing a logistic matrix factorization.

Recently, embedding methods have been proposed to represent users from different social networks into vector spaces with same dimension. To handle the challenge of vector space diversity, existing methods usually make vectors of known aligned users closer/consistent and overlap different vector spaces. However, compared to large amount of users in each social network, the consistence constraint on aligned users is not enough to reduce the diversity. Besides, missing edges/labels may provide incorrect information and affect the effect of the overlap between learned vector spaces. Therefore, we propose the OURLACER method, i.e, jOint UseR and LAbel ConsistencE Representation, to jointly represent each user and label under the consistence constraints of know aligned users and shared labels. Specifically, OURLACER utilizes collective matrix factorization to complete missing edges and labels for each user, which can provide sufficient information to distinguish each user. Moreover, OURLACER adds the consistence constraint on shared labels in different social networks. Because each user has own labels, label consistence can restrict each user and greatly reduce the diversity between learned vector spaces.

One important application of such study is to provide a personalize point-of-interest (POI) recommender system to improve users’ experience in LBSNs. However, most of the existing methods provide limited improvements on POI recommendation because they separately employ textual sentiment or latent topic and ignore the mutual effect between them. In this paper, we propose a novel content-aware POI recommendation framework via an adaptive Bayesian Personalized Ranking. First, we make full use of users’ check-in records and reviews to capture users’ intrinsic preference (i.e., check-in, sentiment, and topic preferences). Then, by aggregating users’ intrinsic preferences, we devise an adaptive Bayesian Personalized Ranking to generate the personalized ranked list of POIs for users. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art POI recommendation models in various metrics.","tags":["POI recommendation","Content-aware","Personalized ranking"],"title":"CARec: Content-Aware Point-of-Interest Recommendation via Adaptive Bayesian Personalized Ranking","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiwen Jiang","Wei Tang","Neng Gao","Ji Xiang","Yijun Su"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576108800,"objectID":"d2f3edaf6a1783021a2250aaa5b62cef","permalink":"https://yijunsu.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2019-iconip-kae/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2019-iconip-kae/","section":"publication","summary":"Demographic attributes are crucial for characterizing different types of users in developing market strategy. However, in retail scenario, individual demographic information is not often available due to the difficult manual collection process. Several studies focus on inferring users’ demographic attribute based on their transaction histories, but there is a common problem. Hardly work has introduced knowledge for purchase data embedding. Specifically, purchase data is informative, full of related knowledge entities and common sense. However, existing methods are unaware of such external knowledge and latent knowledge-level connections among items. To address the above problem, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Embedding (KAE) method that incorporates knowledge graph representation into demographic prediction. The KAE is a multi-channel and item-entity-aligned knowledge-aware convolutional neural network that fuses frequency-level and knowledge-level representations of purchase data. Through extensive experiments on a real world dataset, we demonstrate that KAE achieves substantial gains on state-of-the-art demographic prediction models.","tags":["Demographic prediction","Convolutional neural networks","Knowledge graph representation"],"title":"Demographic Prediction from Purchase Data Based on Knowledge-Aware Embedding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yijun Su","Xiang Li","Daren Zha","Wei Tang","Yiwen Jiang","Ji Xiang","Neng Gao"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1576108800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576108800,"objectID":"a46718f9e65cca5e7e1e7b6fed49592b","permalink":"https://yijunsu.github.io/publication/conference-paper/2019-iconip-hrec/","publishdate":"2019-12-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper/2019-iconip-hrec/","section":"publication","summary":"POI (point-of-interest) recommendation as an important location-based service has been widely utilized in helping people discover attractive locations. A variety of available check-in data provide a good opportunity for developing personalized POI recommender systems. However, the extreme sparsity of check-in data and inefficiency of exploiting unobserved feedback pose severe challenges for POI recommendation. To cope with these challenges, we develop a heterogeneous graph embedding-based personalized POI recommendation framework called HRec. It consists of two modules the learning module and the ranking module. Specifically, we first propose the learning module to produce a series of intermediate feedback from unobserved feedback by learning the embeddings of users and POIs in the heterogeneous graph. Then we devise the ranking module to recommend each user the ultimate ranked list of relevant POIs by utilizing two pairwise feedback comparisons.

Different from traditional models only supervised by content labels, SCS simultaneously leverages the style and content supervision to separate the task-specific features of style and content, and then mixes the style-specific and content-specific features using bilinear model to capture the hidden correlation between them.

(1) These approaches cannot effectively and efficiently exploit unobserved feedback and are also unable to learn useful information from it. (2) How to seamlessly integrate multiple types of context information into these models is still under exploration. To cope with the aforementioned challenges, we develop a new Personalized pairwise Ranking Framework based on Poisson Factor factorization (PRFPF) that follows the assumption that users’ preferences for visited POIs are preferred over potential POIs, unvisited POIs are less preferred than potential POIs. The framework PRFPF is composed of two modules candidate module and ranking module. Specifically, the candidate module is used to generate a series of potential POIs from unvisited POIs by incorporating multiple types of context information (e.g., social and geographical information). The ranking module learns the ultimate order of users’ preference by leveraging the potential POIs.

However, in the task of Chinese character recognition, there is a significant problem in CNN-based classifiers:insufficient generalization ability to recognize the Chinese characters with unfamiliar font styles. We call this problem the Style Overfitting. In the process of a human recognizing Chinese characters with various font styles, the internal skeletons of these characters are important indicators. This paper proposes a novel tool named Skeleton Kernel to capture skeleton features of Chinese characters. And we use it to assist CNN-based classifiers to prevent the Style Overfitting problem.

Generally, a pair of probable corresponding users on different networks may form a true “Anchor Link”. Most existing methods identify a user based on unique features (username, interests, friends, etc.) and neglect the importance of users local network structure. Therefore, one challenging problem is how to address the user identity linkage problem if only structural information is available. In this paper, we explore techniques for dealing with the fundamental and accumulated information from neighbouring anchor links. Furthermore, we design a Trustworthy Predicting Approach (TPA) for computing the authority of an anchor link, inferring the trustworthiness of a candidate anchor link being true and predicting whether an anchor link is able to be veritably formed.

In this paper, we propose a unified location prediction framework to integrate the effect of history check-in and the influence of social circles. We first employ the most frequent check-in model (MFC) and the user-based collaborative filtering model (UCF) to capture users' historical trajectories and users' implicit preference, respectively. Then we use the multi-social circle model (MSC) to model the influence of three social circles. Finally, we evaluate our location prediction framework in the real-world data sets, and the experimental results show that our model performs better than the state-of-the-art approaches in predicting
